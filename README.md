## For Solving this Usecase, What I have done is :
- Collected the data and organized it to form a meaningful dataset.
- Checked for null values and took care of it.
- Observed the data to form meaningful insights.
<br><br>
- Did Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset.
- Used correlations to form a heatmap.
- Visualizations were made by using Matplotlib and Seaborn Libraries..

## And then I made my model for the Prediction :
- Did Data Preprocessing.
- Used One-Hot Encoding for conversion of categorical data to Numerical data.
- Did Train-Test split

## Trained my Model using :

### _Random Forest Regressor_
- Fitted the model.
- predicted the test scores.
- Plotted the prediction.
- `Prediction plot gave a Normal Distribution curve.`
- Plotted the Best fit line for the model.
- Calculated Mean Absolute error and Root Mean Squared Error.


### _Extra Trees Regressor_
- Fitted the model.
- predicted the test scores.
- Plotted the prediction.
- `Prediction plot gave a slightly better Normal Distribution curve than that of Random Forest.`
- Plotted the Best fit line for the model.
- Calculated Mean Absolute error and Root Mean Squared Error.
